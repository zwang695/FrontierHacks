# FrontierHacks

Repo for FrontierHacks 2019, a 24 hour high school hackathon focused on student communities. FrontierHacks aims to create new opportunities at the frontier of education and computer science for beginner and seasoned coders by partnering with local student based nonprofits. This year, FrontierHacks is proud to partner with SMYLE, an organization devoted to giving back to local and international communities through hands-on learning and volunteering.
